Work on LCAO version of GPAW begun
==================================

Marco Vanin has started his master-thesis project titled "PAW
calculations with atomic basis set".  The goal of the project is to
allow GPAW to do calculations using numerical atomic-centered basis
functions.  

Marco's superviser Kristian Thygesen says:

  "We do not plan to do all electron calculations, but rather to use the LCAO
  as an efficient alternative to the more expensive grid basis. As concrete
  examples this will enable us to do MD simulations, transport calculations
  as well as obtaining rough initial guesses for more accurate grid based
  calculations."
