Documentation
=============

The documentation consists of several parts:

* A detailed :ref:`manual`.
* Some :ref:`faq`.
* Some :ref:`literature`.
* The :ase:`ASE <>` web-page.
* The :epydoc:`Application Programming Interface <gpaw>` XXX create link.
* The Python code - it can be found in :file:`/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/gpaw` (or something similar).

For Python documentation, look at these resources:

* The Python_ home page.
* Try a `Python quick reference card`_ or a `different reference card`_.


If you can't find what you are looking for, ask on the `mailing list`_.

Tutorials
=========

1. Calculation of an :ref:`atomization_energy`.
2. :ref:`structure_optimization`.
3. How to :ref:`plot_wave_functions`.
4. How to calculate :ref:`bandstructures`.
5. :ref:`calculation of optical spectra<tutorial_lrtddft>` with time-dependent DFT.

The tutorials 6. and 7. use old ASE and do not work with the latest
version of GPAW without modifications. The tutorials are being
converted to new format.

6. How to get the :ref:`all_electron_density` and using it for doing e.g. :ase:`Bader <ase/dft/bader.html>` analysis.
7. Calculations with :ref:`ensembles` of exchange-correlation functionals.

.. Note::
   There are example input files also in :ref:`exercises`.
