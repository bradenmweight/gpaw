If you are not familiar with ASE, consider going through the
:ref:`ASE Tutorials <ase:tutorials>` first.

The GPAW tutorials are meant to guide the user through some scripts.
The first section of tutorials cover the most common tasks.  The
second section are intended as introduction to a number of advanced
topics.

If you are new to GPAW, we recommend that you look at the introductory
tutorals and at the :ref:`exercises`.
