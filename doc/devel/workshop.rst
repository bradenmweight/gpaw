====================================================
Electronic structure calculations with the GPAW code
====================================================

Users and developers meeting Technical University of Denmark, May 21-23, 2013
=============================================================================

The meeting provides an overview of the present status of the open
source electronic structure program GPAW. The latest developments will
be illustrated through invited and contributed talks from GPAW
developers/users and other scientists from computational condensed
matter community. Topics include many-body methods for electronic
transport and excitations, new exchange-correlation functionals,
coupled electron-ion dynamics and applications within catalysis and
energy materials research. The meeting comprises two days with oral
presentations and poster session relevant to anyone interested in
GPAW, followed by one day with hands-on coding activities for
developers.
