Development
===========

GPAW development can be done by anyone!  Just take a look at the
:ref:`todo` list and find something that suits your talents!  Read
more about the :ref:`technology` and :ref:`theory
<features_and_algorithms>` behind the code.

The developer guide provides an overview of the PAW quantities and how
the corresponding objects are defined in the code:

.. note --- below toctrees are defined in separate files to make sure that the line spacing doesn't get very large (which is of course a bad hack)

When committing significant changes to the code, remember to add a
note in the :ref:`releasenotes` at the top (current svn) - the version
to become the next release.
