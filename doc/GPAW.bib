Abstract = {We present the implementation of the time-dependent density-functional
   theory both in linear-response and in time-propagation formalisms using
   the projector augmented-wave method in real-space grids. The two
   technically very different methods are compared in the linear-response
   regime where we found perfect agreement in the calculated
   photoabsorption spectra. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the
   two methods as well as their convergence properties. We demonstrate
   different applications of the methods by calculating excitation
   energies and excited state Born-Oppenheimer potential surfaces for a
   set of atoms and molecules with the linear-response method and by
   calculating nonlinear emission spectra using the time-propagation
   method. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {A grid-based real-space implementation of the projector augmented wave
   (PAW) method of Blochl {[}Phys. Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)] for density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform
   three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave
   functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary
   conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and
   Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple
   real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform
   all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth
   valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse
   grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the
   atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and
   lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms
   of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave
   methods, but the memory requirements are higher.},
