Classical electrodynamics
=========================

A quasistatic finite-difference time-domain (QSFDTD)
method for performing classical electrodynamical simulations is implemented in GPAW.
The electric field and the polarization charge density are propagated in time under an influence of external perturbation.
The QSFDTD method can be also merged with time-propagation simulation, which
yields a hybrid multiscale method.
