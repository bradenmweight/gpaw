r"""This module calculates the orbital magnetization vector for each atom.

The orbital magnetization is calculated in the atom-centred approximation
where only the PAW correction to the wave function is assumed to contribute.
This leads to the equation (presented in SI units):

::

                 ===  ===
   a         e   \    \         / a   \*   a   a
  M      = - --  /    /    f   | P     | P    L
   orb,v     2m  ===  ===   kn  \ knsi/  knsj  vij
                 kn   sij

with L_vij containing the matrix elements of the angular momentum operator
between two partial waves.

NB: As a convention, the orbital magnetization is returned without the sign of
the negative electronic charge q = -e.

The orbital magnetization is returned in units of Î¼_B as an array, orbmag_av,
 where a and v are indices for atoms and Cartesian axes, respectively.
