r"""This module calculates the orbital magnetic moment vector for each atom.

The orbital magnetic moment is calculated in the atom-centred approximation
where only the PAW correction to the wave function is assumed to contribute.
This leads to the equation (presented in SI units):

::

                 ===  ===
   a         e   \    \         / a   \*  a      a
  m      = - --  /    /    f   | P     | P      L
   orb,v     2m  ===  ===   kn  \ knsi/   knsi'  vii'
                 kn   sii'

with L^a_vii' containing the matrix elements of the angular momentum operator
between two partial waves centred at atom a.

The orbital magnetic moments are returned in units of Î¼_B without the sign of
the negative electronic charge, q = - e.

    waves. i and j do not refer to the same kind of index.

    nonzero contributions, so the sum can be limited to diagonal blocks
