gpaw.cmr is part of the Computational Materials Repository (CMR)
and allows you to put the results of your calculation in
a database from where you can retreive (sort/fiter) the results again.

In order to use the Computational Materials Repository (CMR) code
do the following:
  1. mkdir -p $HOME/lib/python/cmr
  2. svn co https://svn.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/cmr/trunk $HOME/cmr
  3a. add $HOME/lib/python/cmr to your .bashrc:
        export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/lib/python/cmr:$PYTHONPATH"
  3b. add $HOME/lib/python/cmr to your .tcshrc:
        setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/lib/python/cmr:$PYTHONPATH
